# Hugo Turing modules

This repository contains Turing modules for Hugo.

## Code style

Templates with suffix 'html' are end user callable, but templates with suffix 'tmpl' should not be called by user.

Error/Warning IDs should start with `<level>-turing-<description>` where level is "warning" or "error"
